# 1st International Workshop on Software Engineering and Research Software (SERS'26)

{% capture notice %}
- **Co-located with [ICSE 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (submitted)**
- **1-day in-person workshop (before or after main conference, tbc)**

Large amounts of software are being written for critical research purposes, yet those who write that software are often disconnected from the software engineering research community. And the software engineering research community is not building techniques that solve unique challenges for them.

This initial **Software Engineering and Research Software (SERS)** workshop aims to bring the particular needs of research software engineering to, and those who write that software into, the ICSE community. 

**SERS'26** builds on [Dagstuhl Seminar 24161]([Dagstuhl Seminar 24161](https://www.dagstuhl.de/24161)), "Research Software Engineering: Bridging Knowledge Gaps," held in April 2024, which brought together software engineering researchers and research software engineers to facilitate better understanding and initiate collaborations. By extending this focus, our workshop aims to help software engineering researchers gain knowledge about research software, its developers and maintainers, and the processes they use. 

As part of its program, the workshop provides examples of successful projects involving both software engineering research and research software. These further highlight opportunities for software engineering research in studying this area in more detail: new research challenges that need innovative solutions, new opportunities to apply and study software engineering practices. 

As such, the workshop is also intended to further develop the *community of collaborating software engineering researchers and research software engineers* that was catalyzed by the Dagstuhl seminar.

## Call for papers

The call for papers will be published, if the workshop is accepted to ICSE 2026, by 26 August.

### Submission guidelines

Detailed submission guidelines will be provided, if the workshop is accepted to ICSE 2026, by 26 August 2025.

<!-- From BOKSS'21 website
Prospective participants are invited to submit two types of contributions:

Full papers (max 8 pages) will describe concrete contributions to the BoKSS. They will be structured as follows: — A description of the sustainability problem you address. — A description of the SE solution you propose. – A discussion of how results are measurable (e.g., KPIs). – A presentation of the evidence of contribution to sustainability, ideally including real world experiences. – A discussion of the costs and benefits of your approach. – A presentation of the transferable artifacts you are contributing e.g., replication package, code, examples, documentation, educational materials, case studies.

Extended abstracts (max 2 pages) will describe a motivating challenge problem that has ideally emerged from practice. They will be structured as follows: – The context. – The challenge problem. – The current solution/s (if present) and their strengths and weaknesses.

Workshop papers must follow the ICSE 2021 Format and Submission Guideline, but will use a single blind submission process. All submitted papers will be reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance, significance, and clarity by the program committee. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the EasyChair workshop website. Accepted papers will become part of the workshop proceedings.
